#Getting and Cleaning Data Project
This file shows how all of the scripts work.  
* Set your working directory.
* Create a directory './data'.
* Download the original data from 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip' and then unzip it. Save the data in the directory './data' which you've just created.  

*You can do the above with the code in the 'run_analysis.R' or you can do it mannually.*  

* Create an R script and save it in your working directory(the same directory with the directory './data').
* Load these data into Rstdio: 'X_train.txt', 'y_train.txt', 'subject_train.txt', 'X_test.txt', 'y_test.txt', 'subject_test.txt'.
* Install the package 'dplyr'.
* Run the R code. Then you can merge these data sets, extract measurements on mean and std, replace activity labels with activity names, appropriately name the columns and create a second tidy data.
* Finnaly, write the tidy data in your working directory.
